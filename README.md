Notebooks for the tutorial on Machine Learning for Computer Vision, as part of the first Co-Corporeality workshop.

In the [first](https://github.com/co-corporeality/tutorial-notebooks/blob/master/Architecture%20Classification.ipynb) notebook, we will train an image classifier on images of buildings. The classifier will then be able to tell which architect planned it.

In the [second](https://github.com/co-corporeality/tutorial-notebooks/blob/master/Train%20Classifier.ipynb) notebook we will train an object recognition classifier on different types of objects of your choice. Then, we will download the trained classifier and use it locally for real-time object recognition.
